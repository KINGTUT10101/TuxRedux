## TuxRedux

> **NOTE: This project is still in early development and is lacking documentation. It will be developed over time as I finish up Just Another Sand Game v1.0**

Tux Redux is an immediate-mode UI system for LOVE2D inspired by [SUIT](https://github.com/vrld/suit). It is a continuation of my original extension to SUIT called [Tux](https://github.com/KINGTUT10101/tux/tree/master).

### Project Goals

The following is a list of goals that I intend to fulfill with this project in the future:

*   A familiar and intuitive interface inspired by SUIT
*   Better documentation and more examples
*   More base components
    *   Multiline text fields
    *   Toggle switches
    *   Drop-downs
*   New UI options
    *   Icon support
    *   Padding
    *   Nineslices
    *   Better text alignment
*   Improved layout system
*   High extensibility
    *   New components only require a couple functions and attributes to create
    *   Registering components is as easy as calling tux.utils.register
    *   Internal rendering behavior is easily accessible/replaceable and well-documented
